Step 1: Install Jupyter Notebook
Install Jupyter Notebook by running the following command in our terminal or command prompt:
pip install notebook

Step 2: Open Jupyter Notebook
Open Jupyter Notebook by running one of the following commands in our terminal or command prompt:
jupyter notebook
or
python -m notebook
This command will launch the Jupyter Notebook interface in our default web browser.

Step 3: Install Required Libraries
If we have a requirements.txt file that lists the libraries we need for our project, we can install them using the following command:
1. Open a terminal or command prompt (we can also run this in a Jupyter Notebook cell).
2. Run:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Step 4: Upload Our Jupyter Notebook
1. In the Jupyter Notebook interface, locate the Upload button on the right-hand side.
2. Click on it to open a file dialog and select the Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb) we want to upload.
3. After selecting the file, click Open to upload it.

Step 5: Open Our Jupyter Notebook
Once uploaded, our notebook will appear in the file list. To open it:
1. Locate our notebook file in the Jupyter Notebook interface.
2. Left-click on the notebook name to open it in a new tab.

Step 6: Change the Address of calls.csv, customers.csv, reason.csv, sentiment_statistics.csv, and test.csv
Ensure that the paths to these files are correct in your Jupyter Notebook. Update them as needed to match the location on your machine.

Step 7: Run Our Code
1. Click on a cell in the notebook to select it.
2. To run the selected cell, press Shift + Enter or click the Run button in the toolbar.
3. We can continue to write code in new cells, run them, and see the output right below each cell.
