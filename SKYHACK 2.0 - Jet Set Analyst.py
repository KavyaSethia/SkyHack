# ## Problem Statement

# As United Airlines continues its journey to become the best airline in the history of aviation, it is crucial to provide world-class customer service, for which one of the key areas of focus is our call center operations. Call centers play a critical role in ensuring customer issues are resolved quickly and efficiently, but we face challenges in improving metrics such as Average Handle Time (AHT) and Average Speed to Answer (AST).
# 
# Your task is to optimize these key call center metrics, helping reduce resolution times and providing faster, more efficient service to our customers. You are required to analyze our existing call center data to identify inefficiencies, determine the drivers of long AHT and AST, and suggest strategies to enhance customer satisfaction, reduce escalations, and improve overall operational efficiency.
# 
# **Deliverables**:
# 
# 1. Long average handle time (AHT) affects both efficiency and customer satisfaction. Explore the factors contributing to extended call durations, such as agent performance, call types, and sentiment. Identify key drivers of long AHT and AST, especially during high volume call periods. Additionally, could you quantify the percentage difference between the average handling time for the most frequent and least frequent call reasons?
# 
# 
# 
# 2. We often observe self-solvable issues unnecessarily escalating to agents, increasing their workload. Analyse the transcripts and call reasons to identify granular reasons associated to recurring problems that could be resolved via self-service options in the IVR system. Propose specific improvements to the IVR options to effectively reduce agent intervention in these cases, along with solid reasoning to support your recommendations.
# 
# 
# 
# 3. Understanding the primary reasons for incoming calls is vital for enhancing operational efficiency and improving customer service. Accurately categorizing call reasons enables the call center to streamline processes, reduce manual tagging efforts, and ensure that customers are directed to the appropriate resources. In this context, analyze the dataset to uncover patterns that can assist in understanding and identifying these primary call reasons. Please outline your approach, detailing the data analysis techniques and feature identification methods you plan to use. **Optional task, you may utilize the `test.csv` file to generate and submit your predictions**.

# 1. Long average handle time (AHT) affects both efficiency and customer satisfaction. Explore the factors contributing to extended call durations, such as agent performance, call types, and sentiment. Identify key drivers of long AHT and AST, especially during high volume call periods. Additionally, could you quantify the percentage difference between the average handling time for the most frequent and least frequent call reasons?
# 

# #### NOTE:
# 
# **AHT (Average Handle Time)**:
# 
# Time from when the agent picks up the call to when they hang up
# 
# Formula: AHT = Total Handle Time / Total Number of Calls
# 
# 
# 
# 
# **AST (Average Speed to Answer)**:
# 
# Time spent by the customer in queue till the agent answers the call
# 
# Formula: AST = Total Waiting Time / Total Number of Calls

# In[55]:

# **Factors contributing to extended call durations**:
#     
#     1. Agent Performance
#     2. Agent Tone and Agent Experience

agent_performance


# ### **Analysis**: 
# 
# Waiting time of Agent 616988 is minimum while Waiting time of Agent 547592 is maximum

# ### **Insights**: 
# 
# 1. It's possible that Agent 547592 is very efficient (hence the low handle time) and popular or in demand (which explains the high waiting time). This could mean that more customers prefer waiting for this agent because they trust their expertise, even if it means a longer wait.
# 
# 
# 2. Agent 547592 might also be more experienced or better trained, allowing them to handle issues faster, despite being in high demand.
# 
# 
# 3. Agent 102574, on the other hand, may be taking more time to handle customer queries, possibly due to inexperience or dealing with more complex issues.
# 
# 
# **Here, we can say that high demand can lead to longer waiting times, but efficiency can still result in shorter handle times**

# ## **FACTOR : 2**

# ### **Agent Experience**

# In[74]:


#Agent Experience - Number of calls handled by each agent

df['agent_experience'] = df.groupby('agent_id_x')['call_id'].transform('count')


# In[75]:


# Group by agent experience levels and calculate AHT and AST

# In[76]:


df['experience_level'] = experience_groups


# In[77]:


experience_performance = df.groupby('experience_level')[['handle_time', 'waiting_time']].mean()
experience_performance


# ### **Analysis**: 
# 
# 1. Agents with Low experience have a handle time of 722 seconds and a waiting time of 436 seconds.
# 
# 
# 2. Agents with Very High experience have a handle time of 675 seconds and a waiting time of 437 seconds.

# ### **Insights**: 
# 
# 1. As the experience level increases, the handle time generally decreases. This suggests that more experienced agents are better at resolving issues faster, possibly because theyâve dealt with similar situations more frequently.
# 
# 
# 2. The waiting time remains fairly constant across all experience levels, which could indicate that waiting times are more dependent on external factors (e.g., customer demand or availability) than on agent experience.
# 
# **Here, We can focus on improving the skills of less experienced agents to match the performance of high-experience agents**.

# ### **Agent Tone**

# In[80]:


agent_tone_performance = df.groupby('agent_tone')[['handle_time', 'waiting_time']].mean()
agent_tone_performance


# ### **Analysis**:
# 
# 1. Agents with a polite tone have the lowest handle time (220 seconds), meaning they resolve issues faster.
# 
# 
# 2. Agents with a neutral tone have the highest handle time (750 seconds).
# 
# 
# 3. The waiting time is relatively higher for agents with an unknown tone (446 seconds) and polite tone (461 seconds), while it's lower for agents with an angry (425 seconds) or frustrated tone (424 seconds).

# ### **Insights**:
# 
# 1. Agents who are polite seem to resolve issues the fastest, likely because customers may feel more comfortable and satisfied, leading to quicker resolutions.
# 
# 
# 2. Interestingly, agents with a neutral tone have the longest handle times, suggesting that a neutral approach may not engage the customer as effectively, leading to more drawn-out conversations.
# 
# 
# 3. While angry and frustrated tones show slightly lower waiting times, it doesn't necessarily lead to faster issue resolution, as their handle times are higher compared to polite agents.
# 
# **Here, by providing training the agents to maintain a polite and friendly tone can help improve efficiency.**

sentiment_performance = df.groupby('average_sentiment')[['handle_time', 'waiting_time']].mean()
sentiment_performance


# ### **Analysis**: 
# 
# 1. Handle time (blue dots) shows a wide range, especially when the sentiment is slightly negative (around -0.5). Handle times are scattered from very low to extremely high (~1750 seconds) in this sentiment range.
# 
# 
# 2. Waiting time (orange dots) remains fairly consistent across different sentiment levels, with only minor fluctuations. It stays mostly in the 200-600 seconds range, regardless of whether the sentiment is positive or negative.
# 

# ### **Insights**: 
# 
# 1. When the conversation is neutral or slightly negative, the handle time seems to vary the most. This could mean that when customers are somewhat dissatisfied or unclear, agents might take much longer to resolve the issue, possibly due to more complex discussions or indecisiveness from the customer.
# 
# 
# 2. Interestingly, extremely negative or extremely positive sentiment does not seem to result in longer handle times. This suggests that extreme emotions (either positive or negative) might lead to quicker resolutions, either because the issue is simple or the customer is more direct about their needs.
# 
# 
# 3. Waiting time stays relatively stable across all sentiment levels, indicating that customer sentiment doesnât affect how long they wait to speak to an agent
# 
# **Here, the special attention might be needed for customers who display neutral or slightly negative sentiment to resolve their issues more efficiently**

primary_reason_performance


# ### **Analysis**:
# 
# 1. Checkout has the longest handle time (1016.9 seconds) and high waiting time (724.7 seconds). This suggests that checkout issues are complex and may require more agent intervention.
# 
# 
# 2. Voluntary Cancel has a relatively high handle time (721.9 seconds) and a moderate waiting time (539.5 seconds), meaning it also involves complex interactions.
# 
# 
# 3. Communications, Schedule Change, and Booking have significantly lower waiting times (around 240 seconds) and moderate handle times (between 372 to 490 seconds).
# 
# 
# 4. Issues like Baggage have a shorter handle time (333.6 seconds) but higher waiting time (542.1 seconds), meaning customers wait longer for a relatively quick resolution.

# ### **Insights**:
# 
# 1. Checkout and Voluntary Cancel take the longest to resolve, indicating these areas might benefit from improved processes or tools to reduce agent workload and simplify customer interactions.
# 
# 
# 2. Baggage and Unaccompanied Minor show high waiting times, possibly indicating that these issues are lower in priority or that more resources should be allocated to reduce wait times.
# 
# 
# 3. Communications and Schedule Changes are generally quicker to resolve and have short waiting times, meaning these issues are likely more straightforward and may be ideal candidates for self-service options through IVR systems or online tools.
# 
# **Here, complex issues like Checkout and Voluntary Cancel may need more focus on process improvement, while quicker and simpler tasks like Schedule Changes could be handled more effectively through self-service to reduce agent intervention**

timing_performance


# ### **Analysis**:
# 
# 1. Handle Time slightly increases during peak hours (from 697.05 seconds to 697.16 seconds). This shows that calls take a bit longer to handle when the call center is busier.
# 
# 
# 2. Waiting Time is lower during peak hours (drops from 437.09 seconds to 435.55 seconds), meaning customers wait less to get connected to an agent during peak times.

# ### **Insights**:
# 
# 1. The increase in handle time during peak hours is very small, suggesting that the agents are able to manage calls efficiently, even when demand is higher.
# 
# 
# 2. Interestingly, the waiting time decreases during peak hours, which might indicate that more resources (agents) are allocated during peak times, allowing for quicker customer service, or the system prioritizes faster connections during busy periods.
# 
# **Here, peak hours donât significantly impact handle time, but they do reduce waiting time slightly, which is a positive indicator for resource management during busy periods**

# ### **Analysis**:
# 
# 1. Handle time is highest when the customer has a neutral tone (707.6 seconds) and lowest when the customer is polite (689.7 seconds).
# 
# 
# 2. Waiting time remains fairly consistent across all tones, ranging from 436 to 438 seconds.

# ### **Insights**:
# 
# 1. Customers with a neutral tone seem to have the longest handle times. This could indicate that neutral-toned customers are more reserved or unclear about their issues, which requires more back-and-forth to resolve their problems.
# 
# 
# 2. Interestingly, customers who are polite have the shortest handle times, suggesting that polite customers might communicate their needs more clearly, leading to faster resolutions.
# 
# 
# 3. Waiting time is consistent across different customer tones, indicating that the customer's emotional state doesnât impact how long they have to wait to speak to an agent.

# 1. Higher loyalty customers (elite levels 4 and 5) tend to have longer handle times. This could indicate that these customers are given more personalized attention, or their issues might be more complex due to the value they bring to the business.
# 
# 
# 2. However, these high-loyalty customers also experience shorter waiting times, suggesting that they are prioritized in the queue and attended to more quickly, likely due to their importance to the business.
# 
# 
# 3. Lower loyalty customers (elite level 0) have shorter handle times but longer waiting times, suggesting that they are not given the same priority as elite customers.

# ### **Silenece Percentage**

# In[105]:


silence_performance = df.groupby(pd.cut(df['silence_percent_average'], bins = 4))[['handle_time', 'waiting_time']].mean()
silence_performance


# ### **Analysis**:
# 
# 1. Handle time increases significantly as the silence percentage increases. For the lowest silence percentage range (0-24.5%), the handle time is 424.75 seconds, while for the highest range (73.5%-98%), it reaches a staggering 1493.25 seconds.
# 
# 
# 2. Waiting time, on the other hand, remains fairly consistent, ranging between 431 and 439 seconds, with the highest silence percentage range having a slightly lower waiting time.

# ### **Insights**:
# 
# 1. As the silence percentage increases, the handle time dramatically increases. This suggests that long periods of silence during a call may be linked to complex or unresolved issues where both the customer and agent might be uncertain about how to proceed, leading to longer conversations.
# 
# 
# 2. The waiting time does not seem to be significantly impacted by silence percentage, meaning that how long a customer waits before speaking to an agent doesnât affect how much silence there is during the call.
# 
# **Here, reducing silence by providing more guidance or clarity during the call could help reduce the overall handling time**

# ### **Key drivers of long AHT and AST (During High Call Volume Periods)**

# **Finally we can say that, based on the above analysis, the following factors contribute to longer AHT and AST, particularly during high-volume call periods:**
# 
# 1. Customer Tone
# 2. Agent Experience
# 3. Primary Call for Reason
# 4. Peak Hours
# 5. Silence Percentage
# 6. Customer Loyalty Status

# **Common Insights and Uncovering New Findings:**
# 
# 1. Long handle times are driven by unclear communication (neutral tone), complex call reasons (checkout), and high silence percentages.
# 
# 
# 2. Peak hour efficiency: While waiting times decrease, handle times increase slightly due to higher pressure.
# 
# 
# 3. Improving clarity through agent training, self-service options, and structured call flows can reduce handle times.
# 
# 
# **Uncovering Insights:**
# 
# 1. Silence percentage is a critical factor for long handle times across all call types. Reducing silence through better agent guidance and conversation strategies is a key area for improvement.
# 
# 
# 2. Communication clarity is crucial. Enhancing customer-agent interactions during neutral tone and complex issues can significantly reduce AHT.
